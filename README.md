## Setup Guide

This project requires a atleast **Node.js version 20**.

All the config that is needed to personalise the CDK App to your environment is defined in the [.projenrc.ts file](./.projenrc.ts).

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Fork / clone this repo

2. Add a Personal Access Token to the repository settings on GitHub, follow these [instructions for setting up a fine-grained personal access token](https://projen.io/docs/integrations/github/#fine-grained-personal-access-token-beta).

3. Install the projects dependencies using: `npm ci`

4. Customize the AWS Region and Account IDs in the [.projenrc.ts](./.projenrc.ts) file to match your AWS setup:

```typescript
/* Define the AWS region for the CDK app and github workflows
Default to us-east-1 if AWS_REGION is not set in your environment variables */
const awsRegion = process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1';

// Define the target AWS accounts for the different environments
type Environment = 'test' | 'production';

interface EnvironmentConfig {
  accountId: string;
  enableBranchDeploy: boolean;
}

const environmentConfigs: Record<Environment, EnvironmentConfig> = {
  test: { accountId: '987654321012', enableBranchDeploy: true },
  production: { accountId: '123456789012', enableBranchDeploy: false },
};
```

5. Run `npx projen` to generate the github actions workflow files.

6. AWS CLI Authentication: Ensure you're logged into an AWS Account (one of the ones you configured in step 4) via the AWS CLI. If you haven't set up the AWS CLI, [then follow this guide](https://towardsthecloud.com/set-up-aws-cli-aws-sso))

7. Deploy the CDK toolkit stack to your AWS environment with `cdk bootstrap` if it's not already set up.

8. Deploy the GitHub OIDC Stack to enable GitHub Actions workflow permissions for AWS deployments. For instance, if you set up a `dev` environment, execute `npm run dev:deploy`.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CDK deploy pipeline in GitHub.

Congratulations üéâ! You've successfully set up your project.

## Project Structure

When working on smaller projects using infrastructure as code, where you deploy single applications that don't demand extensive maintenance or collaboration from multiple teams, it's recommended to structure your AWS CDK project in a way that enables you to deploy both the application and infrastructure using a single stack.

However, as projects evolve to encompass multiple microservices and a variety of stateful resources (e.g., databases), the complexity inherently increases.

In such cases, adopting a more sophisticated AWS CDK project organization becomes critical. This ensures not only the ease of extensibility but also the smooth deployment of each component, thereby supporting a more robust development lifecycle and facilitating greater operational efficiency.

To cater to these advanced needs, your AWS CDK project should adopt a modular structure. This is where the **AWS CDK starterkit** shines ‚ú®.

Here's a closer look at how this structure enhances maintainability and scalability:

```bash
.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json

```

As you can see in the above tree diagram, the way this project is setup it tries to segment it into logical units, such as **constructs** for reusable infrastructure patterns, **stacks** for deploying groups of resources and **assets** for managing source code of containers and lambda functions.

Here is a brief explanation of what each section does:

- `src/assets`: Organizes the assets for your Lambda functions and ECS services, ensuring that the application code is neatly encapsulated with the infrastructure code.
- `src/bin`: Contains utility scripts (e.g., `cicd-helper.ts`, `env-helper.ts`, `git-helper.ts`) that streamline environment setup and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- `src/constructs`: Houses the core building blocks of your infrastructure. These constructs can be composed into higher-level abstractions, promoting reusability across different parts of your infrastructure. Check out the [README in the constructs folder](./src/constructs/README.md) to read how you can utilize environment-aware configurations.
- `src/stacks`: Dedicated to defining stacks that represent collections of AWS resources (constructs). This allows for logical grouping of related resources, making it simpler to manage deployments and resource dependencies. Check out the [README in the stacks folder](./src/stacks/README.md) to read how you can instantiate new stacks.
- `src/lib/main.ts`: This is where the CDK app is instantiated.
- `test`: Is the location to store your unit or integration tests (powered by jest)

## AWS CDK MCP Server Integration

This starterkit is enhanced with the [AWS CDK MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/blob/main/src/cdk-mcp-server/README.md), providing intelligent assistance for your CDK development workflow.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely access external data sources and tools. In the context of this CDK starterkit, it provides:

- **Intelligent CDK Guidance**: Get real-time recommendations for CDK constructs and AWS best practices
- **Construct Discovery**: Find and understand AWS Solutions Constructs and GenAI CDK patterns
- **CDK Nag Integration**: Automatic security rule explanations and remediation guidance
- **Best Practices Enforcement**: The `@cdk-best-practices.mdc` rule ensures you follow this starterkit's architectural patterns

### Prerequisites

To take advantage of the MCP integration, you'll need:

- **Cursor IDE**: Download and install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - an AI-powered code editor
- **uv Package Manager**: Install uv via Homebrew: `brew install uv`
- **Python 3.10**: Install Python 3.10 using uv: `uv python install 3.10`

This integration transforms your development experience from manual documentation lookup to intelligent, context-aware assistance throughout your CDK journey.

## Branch-based Deployments (Ephemeral Environments)

This starter kit supports deploying multiple CDK stacks to the same AWS environments based on the Git branch. This enables you to easily test changes when multiple developers work on the same code base.

When you create a new feature branch and push it to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the CDK stacks to the corresponding AWS environment (e.g., dev, test, staging) based on the branch name.

Additionally, the workflow includes a separate task to destroy the CDK stacks for the feature branch when the branch is deleted or the pull request is closed, ensuring that the resources are cleaned up after the testing is complete.
