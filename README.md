Is AWS complexity draining your engineering resources? Most B2B startups and growing businesses struggle with overwhelming configuration options, time-consuming compliance requirements, and diverting valuable developer talent away from core product development. Without specialized AWS expertise, you risk security vulnerabilities, mounting technical debt, and delayed time-to-market. All while your competitors race ahead.

Traditional AWS consultancies only compound this problem. They're incentivized to bill by the hour, extending projects indefinitely rather than focusing on your business outcomes. We take the opposite approach. Our fixed-price subscription model proves how confident we are in delivering results, not just billable hours. We succeed when you succeed, aligning our incentives with your growth rather than your AWS complexity.

## Our Solution: Enterprise-Grade AWS Foundation

We deliver an enterprise-grade AWS Landing Zone built entirely in AWS CDK coupled with a support and consultacy foundation that grows with your business needs. Here's what we'll deliver to you:

- We proactively do quarterly [security](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review) and [cost optimization](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) assessments to verify AWS account compliance and provide advice to reduce your AWS bill

### What This Means For Your Business
- **30% Lower TCO**: Cut your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by up to 30% through right-sized resources and architectural optimization while eliminating the $150K+ annual cost of a specialized AWS hire
- **Close Enterprise Deals Faster**: Win enterprise clients with SOC2 compliance ready in weeks instead of months - our clients report 50% faster sales cycles with security-conscious customers
- **Unleash Your Development Team**: Redirect up to 30% of engineering time from infrastructure back to revenue-generating product features with our pre-built, compliant components
- **Scale Without Infrastructure Headaches**: Grow from startup to enterprise without ever rebuilding your foundation - our architecture scales seamlessly from your first customer to your millionth

We deliver all of this as a [simple subscription service](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing). No large upfront costs, no lock-in. You'll essentially get a solid and secure landing zone foundation + a decade of AWS expertise without having to hire a full-time Cloud Engineer.

## Setup Guide

This project requires a atleast **Node.js version 20**.

All the config that is needed to personalise the CDK App to your environment is defined in the [.projenrc.ts file](./.projenrc.ts).

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Fork / clone this repo

2. Add a Personal Access Token to the repository settings on GitHub, follow these [instructions for setting up a fine-grained personal access token](https://projen.io/docs/integrations/github/#fine-grained-personal-access-token-beta).

3. Install the projects dependencies using: `npm ci`

4. Customize the AWS Region and Account IDs in the [.projenrc.ts](./.projenrc.ts) file to match your AWS setup:

```typescript
/* Define the AWS region for the CDK app and github workflows
Default to us-east-1 if AWS_REGION is not set in your environment variables */
const awsRegion = process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1';

// Define the target AWS accounts for the different environments
type Environment = 'test' | 'production';

interface EnvironmentConfig {
  accountId: string;
  enableBranchDeploy: boolean;
}

const environmentConfigs: Record<Environment, EnvironmentConfig> = {
  test: { accountId: '987654321012', enableBranchDeploy: true },
  production: { accountId: '123456789012', enableBranchDeploy: false },
};
```

5. Run `npx projen` to generate the github actions workflow files.

6. AWS CLI Authentication: Ensure you're logged into an AWS Account (one of the ones you configured in step 4) via the AWS CLI. If you haven't set up the AWS CLI, [then follow this guide](https://towardsthecloud.com/set-up-aws-cli-aws-sso))

7. Deploy the CDK toolkit stack to your AWS environment with `cdk bootstrap` if it's not already set up.

8. Deploy the GitHub OIDC Stack to enable GitHub Actions workflow permissions for AWS deployments. For instance, if you set up a `dev` environment, execute `npm run dev:deploy`.

9. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CDK deploy pipeline in GitHub.

Congratulations üéâ! You've successfully set up your project.

## Project Structure

When working on smaller projects using infrastructure as code, where you deploy single applications that don‚Äôt demand extensive maintenance or collaboration from multiple teams, it‚Äôs recommended to structure your AWS CDK project in a way that enables you to deploy both the application and infrastructure using a single stack.

However, as projects evolve to encompass multiple microservices and a variety of stateful resources (e.g., databases), the complexity inherently increases.

In such cases, adopting a more sophisticated AWS CDK project organization becomes critical. This ensures not only the ease of extensibility but also the smooth deployment of each component, thereby supporting a more robust development lifecycle and facilitating greater operational efficiency.

To cater to these advanced needs, your AWS CDK project should adopt a modular structure. This is where the **AWS CDK starterkit** shines ‚ú®.

Here‚Äôs a closer look at how this structure enhances maintainability and scalability:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk.context.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json

```

As you can see in the above tree diagram, the way this project is setup it tries to segment it into logical units, such as **constructs** for reusable infrastructure patterns, **stacks** for deploying groups of resources and **assets** for managing source code of containers and lambda functions.

Here is a brief explanation of what each section does:

- `src/assets`: Organizes the assets for your Lambda functions and ECS services, ensuring that the application code is neatly encapsulated with the infrastructure code.
- `src/bin`: Contains utility scripts (e.g., `cicd-helper.ts`, `env-helper.ts`, `git-helper.ts`) that streamline environment setup and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- `src/constructs`: Houses the core building blocks of your infrastructure. These constructs can be composed into higher-level abstractions, promoting reusability across different parts of your infrastructure. Check out the [README in the constructs folder](./src/constructs/README.md) to read how you can utilize environment-aware configurations.
- `src/stacks`: Dedicated to defining stacks that represent collections of AWS resources (constructs). This allows for logical grouping of related resources, making it simpler to manage deployments and resource dependencies. Check out the [README in the stacks folder](./src/stacks/README.md) to read how you can instantiate new stacks.
- `src/lib/main.ts`: This is where the CDK app is instantiated.
- `test`: Is the location to store your unit or integration tests (powered by jest)

## Branch-based Deployments (Ephemeral Environments)

This starter kit supports deploying multiple CDK stacks to the same AWS environments based on the Git branch. This enables you to easily test changes when multiple developers work on the same code base.

When you create a new feature branch and push it to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the CDK stacks to the corresponding AWS environment (e.g., dev, test, staging) based on the branch name.

Additionally, the workflow includes a separate task to destroy the CDK stacks for the feature branch when the branch is deleted or the pull request is closed, ensuring that the resources are cleaned up after the testing is complete.
