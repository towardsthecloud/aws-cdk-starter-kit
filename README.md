> **Towards the Cloud runs the AWS foundation for modern product teams. This means your team ships faster, slashes AWS spend, and stay audit-ready without having to hire a platform squad.**
>
> Unsure where to start? Book a free AWS Account Review. We‚Äôll analyse your AWS environment, hand you a security & cost report, and you decide whether to act on it yourself or have us execute. No pressure, no retainer required up front.

> ### The problem: AWS complexity compounds fast
>
> Ad‚Äëhoc builds become 40‚Äì60% overspend, unmonitored security gaps put customer data at risk, and engineers burn out running infrastructure instead of shipping products.
>
> ### Our managed foundation keeps you moving forward

> - ‚úÖ **Compliant Landing Zone** ‚Äì [Multi-account AWS CDK deployment](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone) with 100% [CIS benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) coverage,
> centralized logging, and SSO-ready access control.
> - ‚úÖ **Production-ready CDK components** ‚Äì Pre-hardened building blocks so teams launch new services without reinventing best practices.
> - ‚úÖ **CI/CD with safe rollbacks** ‚Äì GitOps workflows and governed pipelines that let you release faster with confidence.
> - ‚úÖ **Quarterly cost & security reviews** ‚Äì [Cost Optimisation](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) plus [Security Reviews](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review)
> delivered proactively.
> - ‚úÖ **Fractional Cloud Engineer** ‚Äì On-demand expertise from an architect who implemented enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure for over a decade.
>
> ### Outcomes our customers see
>
> - **30%+ lower AWS bill** ‚Äì Continuous oversight prevents expensive drift ([30‚Äì60% documented savings](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study)).
> - **SOC 2 / HIPAA acceleration** ‚Äì Guardrails, logging, and evidence packs ready on day one.
> - **Audit-ready every quarter** ‚Äì Automated monitoring plus recurring reviews keep findings under control.
> - **Faster product velocity** ‚Äì Engineers build features, not managing infrastructure.
> - **Headcount leverage** ‚Äì A [flexible retainer](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) replaces the cost of a full-time platform team.

## Quick Start

This project requires at least **Node.js version 22**.

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Click the green ["Use this template"](https://github.com/new?template_name=aws-cdk-starter-kit&template_owner=towardsthecloud) button to create a new repository based on this starter kit.

2. Install the project dependencies using: `npm ci`

3. Customize the AWS Region and Account IDs in the [.projenrc.ts](./.projenrc.ts) file to match your AWS setup.

4. Run `npx projen` to generate the GitHub Actions workflow files.

5. Ensure you're logged into an AWS Account via the AWS CLI.

6. Deploy the CDK toolkit stack with `cdk bootstrap` if it's not already set up.

7. Deploy the GitHub OIDC Stack to enable GitHub Actions workflow permissions for AWS deployments.

8. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CDK deploy pipeline in GitHub.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your project.
